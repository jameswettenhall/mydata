"""
Methods for signing Mac builds.

Mac builds must be signed on a machine running macOS / Mac OS X.

Before signing builds, you must:

    1. Install the Xcode command-line tools:
        From the Terminal, type: xcode-select --install

    2. Have a "Developer ID Application" certificate in your KeyChain:
        (i) You or your organization must have:
              - an account at https://developer.apple.com/ and
              - an Apple Developer Program membership.
       (ii) Once you can log into https://developer.apple.com/ and
            access an active Apple Developer Program account, you will
            be able to create a "Developer ID Application" certificate.
