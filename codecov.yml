# Adapted from https://github.com/codecov/support/blob/master/codecov.yml
# 
# Overall coverage target changed from auto to 65%
# We don't want GitHub to report that a commit broke the builds,
# when the only problem was that coverage decreased slightly,
# so we use target: 65%, instead of the default target:auto
#
# The patch target is set to 0%, meaning that 0% of lines
# changed in a commit or pull request should be covered by tests.
# Commits which only modify files excluded from coverage in .coveragerc
# are not subject to this check.
#
# See: https://docs.codecov.io/docs/commit-status

  precision: 2
